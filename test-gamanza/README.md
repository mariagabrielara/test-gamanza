Requirements you could not implement: 
- The routes to travel between HOME and EPISODES.
- Created the EpisodesList component but didn't create the filter dropdown.

Bugs that didn’t have time to fix:
- The sort by birthday function of the characters orders the list by birthday and not birthdate.

Things I would do if you had more time to complete the task:
- Better the styles portion of the project so it's
 nicer to the eye of the user.
 - Complete the rest of the functionality of the project.
